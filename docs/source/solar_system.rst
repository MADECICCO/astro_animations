Planetary Orbits and Kepler's Laws

Integrate the orbits of two planets around a star, neglecting the
gravitational force between the planets themselves. This is useful for
demonstrating Kepler's third law. We work in units of AU, years, and
solar masses. The semi-major axes are picked such that one planet has
an orbital period of 1 year and the other of 2 years.

As the animation plays, you should see that the speed of the outer
planet varies, becoming fastest at perihelion and slowest a
aphelion. You will also see that the outer planet takes longer to
complete its orbit around the Sun, since $P^2 \sim a^3$.
