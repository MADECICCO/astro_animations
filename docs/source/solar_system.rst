Solar System Motion
===================

Planetary Orbits and Kepler's Laws
----------------------------------

.. video:: ../../solar_system_motion/orbit2/orbit2.mp4

Integrate the orbits of two planets around a star, neglecting the
gravitational force between the planets themselves. This is useful for
demonstrating Kepler's third law. We work in units of AU, years, and
solar masses. The semi-major axes are picked such that one planet has
an orbital period of 1 year and the other of 2 years.

As the animation plays, you should see that the speed of the outer
planet varies, becoming fastest at perihelion and slowest a
aphelion. You will also see that the outer planet takes longer to
complete its orbit around the Sun, since $P^2 \sim a^3$.

Kepler's Second Law
-------------------

.. video:: ../../solar_system_motion/second_law/second_law.mp4

A demonstration of "equal areas in equal times", by shading the area
swept out by a planet in equal time intervals.

Retrograde Motion
-----------------

.. video:: ../../solar_system_motion/retrograde/retrograde.mp4

Integrate Earth and Mars in their orbits around the Sun, starting a
bit before opposition, and draw a line indicating the line-of-sight to
Mars from Earth against some background stars to show the change in
apparent motion.

Note: the orbits are simplified here -- the semi-major axis and
eccentricity are correct, but it is assumed that both ellipses are
oriented the same way. For demonstration purposes, this is not all
that critical.

Parallax
--------

.. video:: ../../solar_system_motion/parallax/parallax.mp4

A simple animation showing how parallax works, illustrating the motion
of the Earth around the Sun and the apparent shift seen in the
position of a nearby star against the background, more distant stars.
