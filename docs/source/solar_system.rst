Solar System Motion
===================

Planetary Orbits and Kepler's Laws
----------------------------------

.. video:: ../../solar_system_motion/orbit2/orbit2.mp4

Integrate the orbits of two planets around a star, neglecting the
gravitational force between the planets themselves. This is useful for
demonstrating Kepler's third law. We work in units of AU, years, and
solar masses. The semi-major axes are picked such that one planet has
an orbital period of 1 year and the other of 2 years.

As the animation plays, you should see that the speed of the outer
planet varies, becoming fastest at perihelion and slowest a
aphelion. You will also see that the outer planet takes longer to
complete its orbit around the Sun, since $P^2 \sim a^3$.

Kepler's Second Law
-------------------

.. video:: ../../solar_system_motion/second_law/second_law.mp4

A demonstration of "equal areas in equal times", by shading the area
swept out by a planet in equal time intervals.

Retrograde Motion
-----------------

.. video:: ../../solar_system_motion/retrograde/retrograde.mp4

Integrate Earth and Mars in their orbits around the Sun, starting a
bit before opposition, and draw a line indicating the line-of-sight to
Mars from Earth against some background stars to show the change in
apparent motion.

Note: the orbits are simplified here -- the semi-major axis and
eccentricity are correct, but it is assumed that both ellipses are
oriented the same way. For demonstration purposes, this is not all
that critical.

Parallax
--------

.. video:: ../../solar_system_motion/parallax/parallax.mp4

A simple animation showing how parallax works, illustrating the motion
of the Earth around the Sun and the apparent shift seen in the
position of a nearby star against the background, more distant stars.

Mercury's Rotation
------------------

.. video:: ../../solar_system_motion/mercury_rotation/mercury_rotation.mp4

Illustrate a 3:2 resonance between the rotation period and orbital
period of Mercury. The semi-major axis and eccentricity for the planet
drawn match Mercury. The black dot on the surface of the planet
represents a person standing initially directly under the Sun at
perihelion.

Moon's Synchronous Rotation
---------------------------

.. video:: ../../solar_system_motion/moon_rotation/moon_rotation.mp4

Illustrate the synchronous rotation of the Moon. The black dot
represents a person standing on the surface. The orbit is taken to be
circular, for simplicity.

Orbital Energy
--------------

.. video:: ../../solar_system_motion/orbitalenergy/orbitalenergy.mp4

A simple showing the orbit of a planet around the Sun, outputting the
kinetic energy / unit mass, the potential energy / unit mass, and the
total energy / unit mass along the way.

Lunar Period
------------

.. video:: ../../solar_system_motion/lunar_period/lunar_period.mp4

A simple animation showing how the time between successive full Moons
(the synodic lunar period) is greater than the true (sidereal) orbital
period of the Moon.

Sidereal vs. Solar Day (for Earth)
----------------------------------

.. video:: ../../solar_system_motion/sidereal_solar_day/earth.mp4

A simple animation showing how the true rotation period of Earth (the
sidereal day) is shorter than the time between noons (the solar day).

Phases of the Moon
------------------

.. video:: ../../solar_system_motion/lunar_phases/lunar-phases.mp4

A simple animation showing the phases of the Moon and the
corresponding point in the Moons orbit around the Earth, with respect
to the Sun.
